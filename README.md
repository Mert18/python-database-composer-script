## Database composer

I could not find an example dataset with the fields I need. So I am using a few datasets to create the one I want.

### Application

I need to create "users", "tasks" and "completed_tasks" tables in PostgreSQL.

Users table will be fulfilled with this API: https://randomuser.me/api/

For "tasks" table, I will write some functions in this python script.

For "completed_tasks" table, /data/jira_data.csv includes some create and complete dates that I will use.
